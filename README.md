Rock Paper Scissors Project: This project is a recreation of the popular game, rock paper scissors, made by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game will have three buttons to give a player the choice to choose between rock, paper and scissors. The opposing player will be a computer who randomly chooses an option.When a button is pressed, it will display a large picture of what we chose and a corresponding picture will be displayed for the computer player to show what the computer has chosen. Utilizing several variables, if statements, if else statements, and logic that determines who wins, this game will be constructed. Furthermore, the player will be given the option to have a match of best out of 3, best out of 5, best out of 7 or best out of 9. Whoever wins the most matches will be the winner. When the game has ended, it will be announced who the winner is. 

To go into more detail, we will choose 6 pictures in total, 3 would be blue and the other 3 would be red. There will be two pictures of rock, two pictures of scissors and two pictures of paper. The blue team will have one rock, one scissor and one paper and same with the red team. We will start with an option of selecting what kind of match they want and their options would be to have a match of best of three, five, seven or nine. There will also be a button added on the side if the player needs instructions on how to play and . During the match, the player will click on the picture whether he wants to throw, once he has clicked, he will press the submit button to finalize his choice which will be shown through an enlarged picture. The NPC will choose something randomly as well and the winner of the round will be given a point.
